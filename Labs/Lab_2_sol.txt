1- Create the following hierarchy under your home directory:
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ mkdir -p docs/mycv >> for recursive director creation.
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ mkdir -p dir1/dir12
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ mkdir -p dir1/dir11/file1 >> here file1 is a directory.
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ cd dir1/dir11
   [IC@IC dir11]$ touch file1 >> here file1 is a file.
   [IC@IC dir11]$ ls
   file1
   [IC@IC dir11]$ mv file1 file1.txt
   [IC@IC dir11]$ ls
   file1.txt

2- Remove dir11 in one-step. What did you notice? And how did you overcome that?
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ ls
   dir1  docs  file.txt
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ cd  dir1 
   [IC@IC dir1]$ ls
   dir11  dir12
   [IC@IC dir1]$ rm -r dir11
   [IC@IC dir1]$ ls
   dir12

3- Copy the /etc/passwd file to your home directory making its name is mypasswd.
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ cp /etc/passwd mypasswd

4- Rename this new file (which at your home) to be oldpasswd 
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ touch newfile
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ mv newfile oldpasswd

5- Write the command which display the man page of the passwd file”/etc/passwd”.
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ man /etc/passwd

6- Write the command which display a list of all the commands that contain the keyword “passwd” in their man/manual page.

ls: cannot access passwd: No such file or directory

>> the absolute path: [IC@IC ~]$ cd /etc
 

>> relative path: [IC@IC ~]$ cd ../../etc

9- Show the total directory size of /home/<your_user_name>.
>> [IC@IC ~]$ du -sh ./iti
   14M	  ./iti

10- List all files at your /etc which end with .config
>> [IC@IC etc]$ ls *.config
man.config

11- Create a folder called /tmp/myconfig and copy to it all .config files from etc to it
>> [IC@IC Desktop]$ mkdir -p temp/myconfig
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ ls
   dir1  docs  file.txt  mypasswd  oldpasswd  temp
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ cp /etc/man.config ./temp/myconfig/ 
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ ls
   dir1  docs  file.txt  mypasswd  oldpasswd  temp
   [IC@IC Desktop]$ cd temp/myconfig/
   [IC@IC myconfig]$ ls
   man.config

12- Remove the directory /tmp/myconfig
>>  [IC@IC ]$ rm -r ./temp/myconfig

13- Display lines 1 to line 5 of /etc/passwd file
>> [IC@IC myconfig]$ head -5 /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
